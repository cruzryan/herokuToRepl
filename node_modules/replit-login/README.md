# Replit Login

_An unofficial way to authenticate your Replit users_

Authenticate Replit users in your projects without ReplAuth. This uses the actual Replit
Login API to authenticate `connect.sid` tokens and return whether a user would login.

## Install

```shell
$ npm install replit-login
$ yarn add replit-login
```

## Usage

```js
import { login, logout, test } from 'replit-login';

const { username, password, captcha } = process.env;

const { token, message } = await login(username, password, captcha);

console.log('Login:', token ? token : message);
console.log('Test:', await test(token));
console.log('Logout:', await logout(token));
```

_Note: You will need some frontend component that allows you to use the hCaptcha widget
to get hCaptcha tokens. If you are just testing then you can use
[this website](https://replit-captcha.rayhanadev.repl.co/). The tokens expire in 2
minutes._

## Personal Note

In the spirit of open source software I made this codebase public since it only
abstracts API's that already exist without circumventing a captcha. Use it as a
tool and abide by the Replit Terms of Service (see below). Improper use of the package can
result in bans on Replit and possibly legal action.

## Legal
